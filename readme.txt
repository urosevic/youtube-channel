* Thumbnail mode opens the video in lightbox
* [NEW] Optionally store thumbnail images locally for improved speed performance and cache policy
* Enhanced Privacy - please note that display mode **HTML5 (IFRAME) Asynchronous** (shortcode parameter `iframe2`) does not support Enhanced Privacy due to YouTube API limitations

* Final look is highly customisable thanks to classes for each element of YTC block!

= Requirements =

For a fully functional plugin, PHP 7.4 or newer has required! If you use older PHP, we highly recommend you request from your developer, server support or hosting company to update PHP to a secure version.

= Styling =

Use Customizer, `style.css` from the child theme or [Head & Footer Code](https://wordpress.org/plugins/head-footer-code/) plugin to custom style and tweak the look and feel of the My YouTube Channel blocks. You can utilise the following classes:

* `.widget_youtube-channel` – class of whole widget (parent for widget title and YTC block)
* `.youtube_channel` – YTC block wrapper class. Additional classes are available:
  * `.default` – for non-responsive block
  * `.responsive` – when you have enabled responsive option
* `.ytc_title` – class for video title container above thumbnail/video object
  * `.ytc_title_above` – additional class for video title above video/thumbnail
  * `.ytc_title_below` – additional class for video title below video/thumbnail
  * `.ytc_title_inside` – additional class for video title printed inside of the thumbnail
  * `.ytc_title_inside_bottom` – additional class for bottom aligned video title printed inside of the thumbnail
* `.ytc_video_container` – class of container for single item, plus:
  * `.ytc_video_1`, `.ytc_video_2`, … – class of container for single item with ordering number of item in widget
  * `.ytc_video_first` – class of first container for single item
  * `.ytc_video_mid` – class of all other containers for single item
  * `.ytc_video_last` – class of last container for single item
  * `.ar16_9` – class for Aspect Ratio 16:9
  * `.ar4_3` – class for Aspect Ration 4:3
* `.ytc_thumb` – class of anchor for Thumbnail mode
* `.fluid-width-video-wrapper` – class for parent element of IFRAME for enabled responsive
* `.ytc_description` – class for video description text below thumbnail/video object
* `.ytc_link` – class of container for link to channel

= Known Issues =

* Video title and description for embedded playlist mode do not work.
* Removing the YouTube logo from the playback control bar does not work for all videos.
* Autoplay does not work always

If WordFence or other malware scan tool detect My YouTube Channel file `youtube-channel.php` as a potential risk because `base64_encode()` and `base64_decode()` functions, remember that we use this two functions to store and restore JSON feeds to transient cache, so potential detection is false positive.

= Credits =

* For playing videos in lightbox we use [Bigger Picture](https://github.com/henrygd/bigger-picture).

= Shortcode =

Along with Widget, you can add My YouTube Channel block inline by using shortcode `[youtube_channel]`. Default plugin parameters will be used for shortcode, but you can customize all parameters per shortcode.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to get that YouTube Data API Key? =

Please folllow [Installation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/youtube-channel/#installation) instructions.

= The plugin does not work with a premium theme or clash with another premium plugin =

We cannot afford licenses for various premium themes and plugins to keep the fee plugin My YouTube Channel working with each of them.

If My YouTube Channel clash with a premium theme or plugin, we can help you only if you help us. Ask theme/plugin author for approval to provide a package to us for debugging on local development domain `youtube-channel.wp`.

Upload the installation package to your cloud drive (Dropbox, One Drive, Google Drive, iCloud, WeTransfer or other) and provide a share link to us by [contact form](https://urosevic.net/wordpress/contact/?subject=YouTube%20Channel).

= I set everything correct but receiving 'Oops, something went wrong' message =

As a logged-in administrator, you will see an error explanation. Known issues:

> **YTC ERROR:** Please check did you set the proper Channel ID. You choose to show videos from the channel, but YouTube does not recognize MyCoolLegacyName as an existing or public channel.

Do what the message says - check and correct Channel ID in default settings/widget/shortcode.

> **YTC ERROR** Check YouTube Data API Key restrictions, empty cache if enabled by appending in the browser address bar parameter ?ytc_force_recache=1

1. Try to remove restrictions by referer or IP in your **YouTube Data API Key** and refresh the page after a couple of minutes.
1. If that does not help, please try to create a new API Key for Server w/o restrictions (not to regenerate the existing one).

= How to use Google APIs Explorer to verify YouTube feeds? =

If there is no `YTC ERROR` code in HTML source, visit [Google API Explorer](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.playlistItems.list?part=snippet&maxResults=5&playlistId=) and append to the end of URL one of resource ID’s based on your Channel ID:

* for videos from channel replace **UC** with **UU** in Channel ID (so *UCRPqmcpGcJ_gFtTmN_a4aVA* becomes *UURPqmcpGcJ_gFtTmN_a4aVA*)
* for videos from Playlist simply use Playlist ID (like *PLEC850BE962234400* or *RDMMjUe8uoKdHao*)

Note that both resources are *playlists* (including uploads to channel), so append mentioned ID to field **playlistId** (not to **id**), and click **Execute** button at the bottom of that page.

1. If you receive some error in results, tune parameters in APIs Explorer.
1. If there is no error while the response is empty, and you are sure that there are public videos in selected resource – contact Google Support.
1. If there are video results but not displayed with My YouTube Channel plugin – check topic [Read before you post support question or report a bug](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/ytc3-read-before-you-post-support-question-or-report-bug) and then [start new support topic](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/youtube-channel/#new-topic-0).

= What this YTC ERROR/HTTP Error means? =

You will be able to reproduce HTTP Error w/o WordPress if you have SSH access to the server hosting your website. Log in to shell and run the following command (or ask your developer to do so):

`curl https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlistItems`

You will get an HTTP Error from the curl command or response like the one below.

`{
 "error": {
  "errors": [
   {
    "domain": "global",
    "reason": "required",
    "message": "Required parameter: part",
    "locationType": "parameter",
    "location": "part"
   }
  ],
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Required parameter: part"
 }
}`

Known HTTP Errors:

**error:0D0890A1:asn1 encoding routines:ASN1_verify:unknown message digest algorithm**

Server tool curl has built with an older version of OpenSSL that does not support certificates signed with sha256-With-RSA-Encryption. It requires at least OpenSSL 0.9.8o for the total management of SHA256.

Please contact your server administrator or hosting provider to help you with this issue.

**Problem with the SSL CA cert (path? access rights?)**

Yet another server issue, not related to My YouTube Channel nor WordPress.

Please restart Apache (or Nginx) server. If that does not fix the issue, restart the entire server. Or contact server support to help.

= Where to find correct Channel ID and User ID? =

Login to your YouTube account and visit page [Account Advanced](https://www.youtube.com/account_advanced).

**Channel ID** is **YouTube Channel ID** value composed of mixed characters starting with **UC**.

= What is Handle custom URL? =

Check out [Customized URL overview](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2657968?ref_topic=3024172&hl=en-GB) article.

= Where to find Playlist ID? =

Manually extract Playlist ID from YouTube playlist URL. Find string after `&list=` parameter in URL.
Playlist ID can contain lowercase and uppercase letters, dash and underscore characters.
Regular playlists starts with uppercase letters **PL** (like *PLEC850BE962234400*), while Playlist ID for YouTube mixes start with uppercase **RD** (eg. *RDCfMMlT8Lyns*).

= How to force embedding video with better audio quality? =

YouTube provide better videos if the height of the embedded video is 320 or more. If you use a small YTC video size, 240p will be loaded instead. It's not possible to force 720p in tiny YTC.

= I enabled option `Hide YT Logo` and YouTube logo is still visible =

The modestbranding option does not work for all videos. A lot of videos still have the YouTube logo in the control bar. We recommend enabling the option `Hide player controls` instead.

The logo appears in the upper right corner on hover or when the video pauses. [Read more here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#modestbranding)

= How I can achieve a 'wall' layout with one featured thumbnail? =

Start with following shortcode combination:

`[youtube_channel num=7 responsive=1 class=ytc_wall_1-6 resource=2 random=1]`

Then add custom CSS code to Customizer, or child theme **style.css** or to [Head & Footer Code](https://wordpress.org/plugins/head-footer-code/) plugin:

`.youtube_channel.ytc_wall_1-6 .ytc_video_container {
    padding: 5px;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    max-width: 33.333%;
}
.youtube_channel.ytc_wall_1-6 .ytc_video_container.ytc_video_1 {
    max-width: 100%;
}
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    .youtube_channel.ytc_wall_1-6 .ytc_video_container:not(.ytc_video_1) {
        max-width: 50%;
    }
}
@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
    .youtube_channel.ytc_wall_1-6 .ytc_video_container:not(.ytc_video_1) {
        max-width: 100%;
    }
}`

That will show thumbnails for seven random videos from the default playlist defined in plugin settings: one full-width thumbnail and six remaining thumbnails distributed to 3 columns on wide screens, two columns under 768px and a single thumbnail per row under 480px.

= How I can add pagination (to Dynamic Wall view)? =

My YouTube Channel does not support pagination.

= How to reduce the size thumbnail Play button or remove it? =

Resize thumbnail play button by adding following custom CSS to Customizer, or child theme **style.css** or to [Head & Footer Code](https://wordpress.org/plugins/head-footer-code/) plugin:

`.youtube_channel .ytc_thumb>span:before {
  transform: scale(.65);
}`

To remove (hide) thumbnail play button, use following custom CSS:

`.youtube_channel .ytc_thumb>span:before {
  display: none !important;
}`

= Your plugin does not support *THIS* or *THAT* =

Feel free to submit a feature request by creating a new topic on [Community forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/youtube-channel/). Make sure to prefix *Topic Title* with **[Feature Request] ...**
Please note, we cannot guarantee an ETA to implement the requested feature.
